Program Description:

This Android app is a reminder app that allows users to input tasks they want to get done and click on them to check them off as done.
What seperates this app from the rest is that as users complete tasks, they accumulate points that gives them a sense of accomplishments.
This reminder system is made to be used for small tasks such as "read a book," or "hang out with a friend."
Users also have the option of selecting "Once," "Daily," or "Weekly" to signify how often they want the reminders to appear. This way,
the app can remind users to continuously do those small tasks.
